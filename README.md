Steps to run project:

1) gulp serve - to run project in development mode

2) gulp deploy - to run project in production mode

For gulp deploy to work, you need to change the index.html in deploy folder. Remove all the scripts and add a script tag to include all.js and then run index.html through a server(just because I didn't got enough time to work on this project).
